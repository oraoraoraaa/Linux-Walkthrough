# Arch Linux
## Setup
### Language display
Upon first installation of Arch Linux system, the system should be generally in English and does not support any other languages. Other languages (like Chinese) is not recognizable and therefore displayed as blocks. This is because:
1. Specific language support not enabled due to **locale** settings.
2. Missing corresponding **fonts**.
